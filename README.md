# Requirements

You have to write an application to submit your CV and the code you are about to write to a REST API as a Zip file. Before you can do this, you first need to authenticate yourself against another REST API to get the temporary URL where you need to submit your CV. Problem is you forgot the password, or at least you forgot how to spell the password.

You know the password is "password", or was it "Password", or even "P@55w0rd"… you just can't remember. Sometimes you replace the ‘a’ with a ‘@’, your ‘s’ with a ‘5’ and your ‘o’ with a ‘0’, but not always. "Not a problem…", you think to yourself, because you will also write a bit of code to generate a dictionary and launch an attack on the WEB API until you are able to guess the correct password. If your plan works, you will get the temporary URL of the REST API where you need to submit your CV, and you will be well on your way to getting your dream job.
